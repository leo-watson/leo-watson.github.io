I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Toronto. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Radu Craiu](https://raducraiu.com/) and Prof. [Joshua Speagle](https://joshspeagle.com/). Prior to my Ph.D. study, I received my B.S. in Statistics also from the University of Toronto in 2024.

*Disclaimer*: This website is still a WIP - please see CV if keen.
