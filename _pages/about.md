I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Toronto. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Radu Craiu](https://raducraiu.com/) and Prof. [Joshua Speagle](https://joshspeagle.com/). Prior to my Ph.D. study, I received my B.S. in Statistics also from the University of Toronto in 2024.

During undergrad, I was not entirely sure what I wanted to specialize in -- let alone what to do post graduation. I bounced around programs in physics, maths, and economics, and did a quite random set of summer projects:  trading intern on the markets floor at [a bank](https://www.citi.com/), quantum physics related university work through the [Ministry of Education](https://www.mext.go.jp/en/), and some applied ML projects in econometrics at UofT. 

Towards the end of undergrad, I converged to statistics and am currently enjoying the Ph.D. greatly!
